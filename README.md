# No Man Is An Island

*You wake up in a unfamiliar place. You remember nothing, but someone appears to tell you where to find all the answers. What will you choose to do?*

## Creator's word

This is my first game project published in itch.io. I like this theme because it is a good starting point to think, and review, over myself. This game is story-driven and I've spent much time on building the dialogue system framework, so there aren't many real stuffs to play. Anyway, I enjoy this mouth pretty much and I hope you will enjoy reading the story as well.
